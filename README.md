# Maze Solver

Java-based program that solves a maze represented as a text file. It uses a depth-first search algorithm to navigate through the maze and determine the path to the goal. 

# Features and How to use

The maze is represented as a 2D character array, where: <br>
	•	'S' indicates the starting point <br>
	•	'F' indicates the finish point <br>
	•	'0' represents valid paths <br>
	•	Other characters represent walls or obstacles <br> <br>

 To use: <br>
  	1.  	Create a text file named laberinto.txt with the maze structure, using the characters defined above <br>
	2.	Run the program <br>
	3.	The program will read the maze from the file and output the sequence of movements needed to reach the finish point <br>
	
# What I Learned!

* Improved my understanding of algorithms and recursion through the implementation of a maze-solving strategy
* Gained experience in file I/O operations in Java for reading data from external files
